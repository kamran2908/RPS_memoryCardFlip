Hello people <br>
This repository is a part of my web programming course <br>
A detailed explanation about what this repository is about <br>

This is basically a game which has two round where a player who wins both the round gets a point
round 1: 
this round is Rock-Paper-Scissors which is quite familiar to all
the player who wins in round 1 (does not score a point) goes to round 2

round 2:
this round is Memory Card Flip where in you have a series of cards each card has some symbol (like emojis , fruites , animals ) pair of cards have same symbol . 
You have to pick only two cards if these cards have same symbol then u score a point else no
after completing this round you will be redirected to round 1 and this will be continued 
Player who scores 5 points wins the game
